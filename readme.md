# Court Policy

Disables certain events and options unappropriate for court owner's religion or policy. Allows AI or human player to define their own court policy.

## WIP

$${\color{red}Main \space functionality \space not \space implemented.\space}$$

Only setting/unsetting parameters works.

## Motivation

My servant tells me that my son engages in extramarital carnal affairs, I immedialtely mobilize my men to drive the fornicator awayâ€¦ Or should I allow them to produce some grandchildren?

In base game and in Elder Kings, there is only one option. Liege sends the fornicator away and accuses them of adultery. It seems unnatural. Suppose I created a custom religion that accepts all kind of sex and adultery, have some lovers at court. Why should I stop seduce schemes and extramarital sex?

## Technical requirements

* Crusader Kings version Crown 1.15.0.2.
* Elder Kings modification version 0.15.1.

## Features

1. Allows to define court policy on what is allowed by general people.
2. Allows to define court policy on what diseases court physician should never heal.

Currently the following policies can be defined:

* Allow man-to-woman extramarital sex.
* Allow man-to-man and woman-to-woman extramarital sex.
* Allow close relatives sex.
* Ban healing of sanies lupinus (that leads to lycantropy).
* Ban healing of sanguinare vampiris (that leads to vampirism).

In absense of policy, defaults appropriate for court owner's religion apply. For instance, ideal masters and other necromantic religions allow any kind of sex and ban healing of both sanies lupinus and sanguinare vampiris.

AI liege might set their policy to their taste. AI policy might be modified in approximately 5 years.
